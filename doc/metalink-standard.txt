GNU Wget Metalink recommended behaviour

  Metalink/XML and Metalink/HTTP standard reference


1. Security features
********************

Only metalink:file elements with safe "name" fields shall be accepted
[1 #section-4.1.2.1]. If unsafe metalink:file elements are saved, any
related test shall fail (see '2. Tests').

By design, libmetalink rejects unsafe metalink:file elements [3]:
* lib/metalink_helper.c (metalink_check_safe_path): Verify path

1.1 Exceptions
==============

The option --directory-prefix could allow to use an absolute, relative
or home path.

2. Tests
********

Saving a file to an unexpected path poses a security problem. We must
ensure that Wget's automated tests never modify the root and the home
paths or descend/escalate to a relative path unexpectedly.

2.1 Metalink/XML implemented tests
==================================

See testenv/Makefile.am (METALINK_TESTS).

2.2 Metalink/HTTP implemented tests
===================================

See testenv/Makefile.am (METALINK_TESTS).

3. Download file name
*********************

The download file name shall be decided by precise rules which prevent
any naming uncertainty and security issues.

3.1 Naming rules
================

The final name of downloaded files is computed starting from a trusted
name, which is then combined with the "Directory Options".  The result
is verified and eventually made safer following security rules. If the
final name isn't found safe enough, then the file isn't downloaded.

Depending on the options used, a suffix could be appended to the final
name to not overwrite existing files.

3.1.1 The trusted name
======================

The option --trust-server-names decides what is the trusted name.

Any Metalink/XML element with an unsafe metalink:file "name" field is
ignored, see '1. Security features'.

3.1.1.1 Without --trust-server-names
====================================

When --trust-server-names is off, the basename of the --input-metalink
file, if available, or of the mother URL is trusted. This trusted name
is the radix of any subsequent file name.

When a Metalink/HTTP in encountered, any fetched Metalink/XML file has
its own ordinal number appended as suffix to the trusted name. In this
case scenario, an unique Metalink/XML file is saved each time applying
an additional suffix to the currently computed name when necessary.

The files described by a Metalink/XML file will be named sequentially
applying an additional suffix to the currently trusted/computed name.

3.1.1.2 With --trust-server-names
=================================

When --trust-server-names is on, the metalink:file "name" field parsed
from Metalink/XML files is trusted. When no Metalink/XML is available,
the mother URL is trusted.

3.1.2 The final name
====================

The "Directory Options" are combined with the trusted name. The result
is evaluated again by the '1. Security features'. If the path is found
unsafe, only the basename of the final name is considered.  If this is
found unsafe too, the file is not downloaded.

4. Metalink/XML
***************

4.1 Example files
=================

See [1 #section-1.1].

cat > bugus.meta4 << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<metalink xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:metalink">
  <file name="/dir/A/File1">
    <size>1617</size>
    <hash type="sha256">ecb3dff2648667513e31554b3ad054ccd89fce38e33367c9459ac3a285153742</hash>
    <url>http://another.url/common_name</url>
    <url>http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-001</url>
  </file>
  <file name="dir/B/File2">
    <size>1594</size>
    <hash type="sha256">eee7cd7062ab29a9e4f02924d9c367264dcb8b162703f74ff6eb8f175a91502b</hash>
    <url>http://another.url/again/common_name</url>
    <url>http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-002</url>
  </file>
</metalink>
EOF

4.2 Command line example
========================

$ wget --input-metalink=bogus.meta4

4.3 Metalink/XML file parsing
=============================

The metalink xml file is parsed by one of the following libmetalink's
functions [3], depending upon the library configured to use:
* lib/libexpat_metalink_parser.c (metalink_parse_file): Expat [4]
* lib/libxml2_metalink_parser.c (metalink_parse_file): Libxml2 [5]

The result returned doesn't include unsafe metalink:file elements, as
stated at point '1. Security features'.

An empty result shall not be considered an error.  Parsing errors will
be informed to the caller of libmetalink's metalink_parse_file().

4.4 Saving files
================

Fetched metalink:file elements shall be wrote using the unique "name"
field as file name [1 #section-4.1.2.1].

A metalink:file url's file name shall not substitute the "name" field.

Security exceptions are explained in '3. Download file name'.

4.5 Multi-Source download
=========================

Parallel range requests are allowed [1 #section-1].

5. Metalink/HTTP
****************

5.1 HTTP server
===============

The local server http://127.0.0.1 is used as reference in the course
of this chapter. Any server service capable of sending Metalink/HTTP
header answers may be used.

5.2 Command line example
========================

$ wget --metalink-over-http http://127.0.0.1/dir/file.ext

5.3 Metalink/HTTP header answer
===============================

See [2 #section-1.1].

5.4 Saving files
================

When none of --output-document and/or --content-disposition is used,
the file name to wrote is computed from the cli's url hierarchy. The
purpose of the "Directory Options" is as usual, and the file name is
the cli's url file name, see wget(1).

The url followed to download the file shall not substitute the cli's
url to compute the file name to wrote, except when it redirects to a
Metalink/XML file, following the rules in '3. Download file name'.

5.5 Multi-Source download
=========================

Parallel range requests are allowed [2 #section-7].
